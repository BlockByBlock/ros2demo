# Minimal python publisher for Call Button 

Learning points

* Depending on the method of invoking the executable (.py), there has to be modification to the directory

If you are trying to call ros2 run ... that wonâ€™t work since that command expects the executable to be in the path <install-prefix>/lib/<pkgname>. The script is likely being installed into <install-prefix>/bin and is therefore already on the PATH. You should be able to invoke the executable directly using just the name.

* ros2 run <pkg> <executable> <--- this requires a setup.cfg file to install in the /lib directory

e.g.
[develop]
script-dir=$base/lib/button_call
[install]
install-scripts=$base/lib/button_call

* run by python3 ./<executable> if compile without setup.cfg

# Connect nanopi to comp using USB to UART converter

# ssh into nanopi
ssh root@192.168.1.21

# On Pi
cd ~/demo && python3 ./serialButton.py

# On COM
cd ~/ros2_ws && . install/local_setup.bash
cd ~/Downloads/RMF_demo && python3 ./button_pub.py
